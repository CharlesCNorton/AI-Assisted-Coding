# Pygame Brick Breaker

This repository contains a simple but fun Brick Breaker game coded using Python's Pygame library.

## Game Features

1. The game has a player-controlled paddle and a ball. The goal is to destroy all the bricks by hitting them with the ball without letting the ball fall past the paddle.

2. The game contains a scoring system, where the player's score increases with each brick they destroy.

3. The paddle stays within the screen boundaries to ensure smooth gameplay.

4. When the ball hits the bottom of the screen, the game ends, and a "Game Over" message is displayed.

5. If the player successfully destroys all the bricks, a "You Win" message is displayed, signifying the end of the game.

## How to Run the Game

Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your computer. Then, run the `brick_breaker.py` file in your Python environment to start the game.

## Controls

Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle. The ball moves automatically.

Enjoy the game!
