Advanced Pygame Brick Breaker
Welcome to our freshly revamped Brick Breaker game, now packing an arsenal of new features! This enhanced edition, coded in Python using the Pygame library, offers an even more engaging gaming experience.

Updated Game Features
Player-Controlled Paddle and Ball: Just like before, control a paddle to keep the ball in play, but this time with added dynamics. The ball's trajectory varies based on where it hits the paddle, giving you more control over your strategy.

Dynamic Ball Speed: To add a touch of unpredictability and challenge, the ball speed now adjusts according to the motion of the paddle, making the game play more lively and adding a layer of skill.

Enhanced Scoring System: Enjoy the thrill of your score increasing with each brick you shatter. The game keeps track of your score and displays it on the screen.

Colorful Bricks: The bricks now come in different colors, adding a visual appeal to your gaming experience.

Sound Effects: Immerse yourself in the gameplay with our new 'bonk' sound effects that play on collision.

End Game Indicators: The game concludes with a "Game Over" message when the ball hits the bottom. If you prove victorious and destroy all the bricks, a "You Win!" message is displayed.
