# Cozy Fireplace Scene Generator

This project is a Python script that uses matplotlib to generate an abstract, cozy fireplace scene. The script uses matplotlib's patches module to draw shapes representing elements of a fireplace scene, such as the fireplace itself, logs, flames, a mantlepiece, decorations, a rug, a cat, and a window. The positions, sizes, and colors of the logs and flames are randomly generated each time the script is run, creating a unique scene each time.

This project was created with the assistance of GPT-4, an advanced language model developed by OpenAI. GPT-4 provided the initial code and guided the iterative process of refining and expanding the fireplace scene, coming up with innovative ideas to make the scene cozier and more detailed.

To run the script, simply execute it with a Python interpreter. It will display a menu with options to draw the scene or exit. After drawing the scene, it will display the menu again, so you can draw the scene multiple times or exit when you're done.
