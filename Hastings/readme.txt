# Battle of Hastings Simulation

This project simulates the Battle of Hastings, a pivotal event in history. 

## How it works

The simulation follows a timeline of events that occurred during the battle, updating the morale of the English and Norman armies based on these events. The user is presented with each event in turn and can see how the morale of each side changes as the battle progresses.

## Running the simulation

To run the simulation, simply execute the `BattleSimulation.py` script in Python. The simulation will start automatically. Press any key to proceed through the events of the battle. To quit the simulation early, type 'q' and press Enter.
