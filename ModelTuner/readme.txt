# Fine-Tuning Language Models

This project contains a Python script for fine-tuning pre-trained language models using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

## Usage

1. Run the script in a Python environment with the necessary libraries installed (Transformers, Torch).

2. When prompted, enter the directory path of the pre-trained model, the path to the training data, the directory to save the fine-tuned model, the number of training epochs, and the per-device train batch size.

3. The script will then fine-tune the model on the training data and save the fine-tuned model to the specified directory.

## Note

This script is a work in progress. It currently provides basic functionality and error handling, but further improvements are planned. Please use with caution and feel free to contribute.
