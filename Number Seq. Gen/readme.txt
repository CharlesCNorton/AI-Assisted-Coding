# Number Sequence Generator

This program generates a continuous sequence of numbers from start to end, with an optional step size. The user can choose to display the numbers all at once or one by one. This simple command-line program is great for learning about generators, the sleep function, input validation, and error handling in Python.

## Getting Started

You can run this program on your machine locally. Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

## How to Use

1. Run the program in your terminal using Python: `python3 sequence_generator.py`.
2. Enter the start of the sequence, end of the sequence, and the step size as prompted.
3. When asked if you want to display all numbers at once, type "y" for yes or "n" for no. If "no" is selected, the numbers will be displayed one at a time with a delay of one second between each number.

## Improvements in Latest Version

* Added error handling for invalid input
* Modified the printout for "display all at once" to show the entire sequence instead of the generator object.
