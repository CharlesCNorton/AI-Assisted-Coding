# Improved YouPy

This script is an improved version of the original YouPy, a YouTube downloader. It allows users to download either the video or audio from a specified YouTube URL.

## Features

1. Robust exception handling: If there's an issue with the URL, the user is prompted to enter another one, rather than the script merely printing an error message and proceeding to the next step.
2. Improved modularity: The code has been broken down into smaller, more manageable functions, improving both readability and maintenance.
3. Centralized user prompts: All user prompts are placed in a single dictionary for easier management and modification.
4. Intelligent filename handling: If a file with the same name exists, the script automatically creates a new file with a suffix to avoid overwriting.
5. Visually appealing progress bar: The script displays a progress bar during downloads, providing a more intuitive progress indicator to the user.

## Usage

Run the script in a Python environment with necessary libraries installed (pytube, os, re). Follow the prompts to download your desired YouTube content.

## Improvements

The improvements were made by an AI model from OpenAI, demonstrating the potential of artificial intelligence in enhancing and iterating complex tasks.
